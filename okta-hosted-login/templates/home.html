    <p>Welcome back, <span></span>!</p>
    <p>You have successfully authenticated against your Okta org, and have been redirected back to this application.</p>

<div>
    <p>Hello!</p>
    <p>If you're viewing this page then you have successfully configured and started this example server.</p>
    <p>This example shows you how to to add the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/authentication-guide/implementing-authentication/auth-code.html">Authorization Code Flow</a> to your Flask application.
	This fork of the original code also includes code that uses <a href="https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation">GCP Workload Identity Federation</a> to exchange the logged in user's OIDC id 
    token against a federated GCP token. With this configuration GCP Workload Identity Federation maps the user group claim in the id token to a component of the 
	GCP principal. This demo shows how a user's Okta group membership (admin, user, any) determines which GCS storage buckets is accessible to
	the logged in user (and all other users in the same user group when they log in). 
    When you click the login button below, you will be redirected to the login page on your Okta org. After you authenticate, you will be returned to this application.
